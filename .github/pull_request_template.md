# Predis Pull Request

## Summary
<!-- Brief description of changes and why they were made -->

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change that fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change that adds functionality)
- [ ] Performance improvement (change that improves GPU/cache performance)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)
- [ ] Documentation update

## GPU/Performance Impact
<!-- Required for all code changes affecting cache operations -->

**Before:**
- Baseline performance: X ops/sec
- Memory usage: Y MB VRAM
- GPU utilization: Z%

**After:**
- New performance: X ops/sec (+/- % change)
- Memory usage: Y MB VRAM (+/- change)
- GPU utilization: Z% (+/- change)

**Benchmarking:**
- [ ] Ran `./bin/arch_validation_test` successfully
- [ ] Compared against Redis baseline (if applicable)
- [ ] Validated GPU memory usage with `nvidia-smi`
- [ ] Performance regression testing completed

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests added/updated and passing
- [ ] Integration tests pass locally
- [ ] GPU functionality tested in Docker environment
- [ ] Architecture validation test passes
- [ ] Performance benchmarks run and documented

**Test Coverage:**
- New code coverage: X% (aim for >80%)
- Overall project coverage: Y%

## Code Quality Checklist
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines (clang-format applied)
- [ ] Self-review completed - checked for debugging code, TODOs, etc.
- [ ] Error handling added for GPU operations (CUDA error checking)
- [ ] Memory management follows RAII patterns
- [ ] Thread safety considered for cache operations
- [ ] Documentation updated (README, CLAUDE.md, architecture docs)

## GPU/CUDA Specific (if applicable)
- [ ] CUDA error checking implemented with `cudaGetErrorString`
- [ ] GPU memory leaks checked (all `cudaMalloc` have corresponding `cudaFree`)
- [ ] GPU memory alignment and coalescing considered
- [ ] Kernel launch parameters validated
- [ ] Host-device synchronization handled properly

## Reviewer Guidelines

**Focus Areas for Review:**
1. **GPU Performance**: No memory leaks, efficient GPU utilization
2. **Cache Logic**: Correct key-value operations, thread safety
3. **Error Handling**: Robust GPU error recovery, clear error messages  
4. **Code Style**: Follows project conventions, readable and maintainable
5. **Testing**: Adequate coverage, especially for GPU code paths

**Testing Steps:**
```bash
# Build and test locally
make clean-build
make test
./bin/arch_validation_test

# Test in GPU environment  
./dev_scripts/start_dev.sh
# In container: run GPU-specific tests
```
