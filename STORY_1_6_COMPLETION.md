```cpp
// Run comprehensive performance benchmark
client.run_performance_comparison(10000);

// Get detailed statistics
auto stats = client.get_stats();
std::cout << "Performance improvement: " 
          << stats.performance_improvement_ratio << "x" << std::endl;
```

### Consistency Validation
```cpp
// Connect in hybrid mode for validation
client.connect("localhost", 6379, PredisClient::Mode::HYBRID);

// Validate consistency between implementations
bool consistent = client.validate_consistency(1000);
