# Epic 4 Comprehensive Work Plan

**Generated**: January 22, 2025  
**Timeline**: Weeks 17-24 (2 months)  
**Epic Goal**: Transform Predis from working prototype to customer-deployed system with MLOps pipeline  

## Executive Summary

Epic 4 represents a major pivot from "demo polish" to "customer deployment and validation". Given our extraordinary performance achievements (15,000x vs targeted 25x), we're ready to prove value with real customers rather than just improve demos. This work plan outlines a systematic approach to achieve:

1. **2-3 customer pilot deployments** with real workload validation
2. **Production MLOps pipeline** with automated retraining and drift detection  
3. **Series A fundraising readiness** with customer traction and case studies
4. **$5M+ ARR pipeline** from pilot conversions and expansions

## Development Environment Setup for Epic 4

```bash
# 1. Create Epic 4 directory structure
mkdir -p src/mlops/{data_collector,drift_detection,retraining,customer_adaptation}
mkdir -p src/enterprise/{monitoring,deployment,orchestration,integration}
mkdir -p deployment/{cloud_marketplace,docker,monitoring}
mkdir -p fundraising/{pitch_materials,customer_evidence,interactive_demos,due_diligence}
mkdir -p tests/epic4/{mlops,customer,enterprise,integration}

# 2. Install additional dependencies
# MLOps tools
pip install mlflow kubeflow wandb scikit-learn scipy

# Monitoring tools
pip install prometheus-client datadog statsd influxdb-client

# Deployment tools
pip install kubernetes helm docker boto3 google-cloud azure-mgmt

# 3. Set up development databases
docker run -d --name predis-mlops-db -p 5432:5432 postgres:14
docker run -d --name predis-metrics-db -p 8086:8086 influxdb:2.0

# 4. Configure cloud credentials
aws configure  # For AWS marketplace
gcloud auth login  # For GCP marketplace
az login  # For Azure marketplace
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Customer Acquisition Risk
**Risk**: Can't find pilot customers quickly
**Mitigation**: 
- Leverage existing network and advisors
- Offer free pilot with success-based pricing
- Partner with cloud providers for referrals
- Create compelling ROI calculator

### 2. Real Workload Performance Risk
**Risk**: Performance doesn't translate from synthetic to real
**Mitigation**:
- Conservative performance claims (10x vs 15,000x achieved)
- Extensive pre-pilot testing with realistic workloads
- Clear SLAs with escape clauses
- Focus on specific use cases initially

### 3. MLOps Complexity Risk
**Risk**: MLOps pipeline too complex for MVP
**Mitigation**:
- Phase 1: Basic monitoring and manual retraining
- Phase 2: Automated drift detection
- Phase 3: Full automated retraining
- Use existing MLOps platforms (MLflow, Kubeflow)

### 4. Enterprise Security Risk
**Risk**: Security concerns block enterprise adoption
**Mitigation**:
- Early security audit (Week 17)
- SOC 2 Type 1 certification process
- Zero-trust architecture design
- Clear data isolation guarantees
