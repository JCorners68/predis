  - MLOps dependencies pre-installed
  - Health checks and monitoring

- ✅ **AWS CloudFormation** (`deployment/cloud_marketplace/aws/cloudformation_template.yaml`)
  - One-click deployment template
  - Auto-scaling and monitoring
  - Customer isolation

- ✅ **ROI Dashboard** (`src/mlops/customer_roi_dashboard.py`)
  - Real-time value tracking
  - Cost savings calculator
  - Revenue impact analysis

### 4. Key Insights from Analysis

#### From Epic 3 Review:
- ✅ ML infrastructure ready (inference engine, models, monitoring)
- ✅ 22.3% hit rate improvement validated
- ✅ 4.8ms inference latency achieved
- ✅ Write performance fixed (20x+ improvement)

#### Missing for Epic 4:
- ❌ Production MLOps pipeline
- ❌ Enterprise security features
- ❌ Customer deployment automation
- ❌ Full Redis API compatibility
- ❌ Multi-tenant isolation

### 5. Immediate Next Steps When You Return

#### Week 17 Sprint (MLOps Foundation):
1. **Morning**: Implement CircularBuffer in production_data_collector.cpp
2. **Afternoon**: Build KS test and PSI calculations
3. **Day 2**: Create retraining pipeline with MLflow
4. **Day 3**: Add A/B testing framework
5. **Day 4**: Test with synthetic workloads
6. **Day 5**: Deploy to test environment

#### Customer Outreach Prep:
1. Review target customer list in work plan
2. Create pitch deck from template
3. Build ROI calculator web app
4. Prepare technical demo script

### 6. Risk Mitigation Ready

#### Technical Risks Identified:
1. **Real workload performance** - Conservative claims (10x vs 15,000x)
2. **Production stability** - Extensive testing framework
3. **Security concerns** - Early audit scheduled

#### Mitigation Plans:
- Phased MLOps rollout (basic → advanced)
- Cloud marketplace for easy trials
- Federated learning for privacy
- Automated rollback on issues

### 8. Development Environment

When you return, run:
```bash
# Install Epic 4 dependencies
pip install mlflow kubeflow wandb prometheus-client kubernetes docker boto3 google-cloud

# Start development databases
docker run -d --name predis-mlops-db -p 5432:5432 postgres:14
docker run -d --name predis-metrics-db -p 8086:8086 influxdb:2.0

# Verify GPU environment
nvidia-smi
```

### 9. Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Build with MLOps enabled
cd build && cmake -DMLOPS_ENABLED=ON .. && make -j$(nproc)

# Run MLOps tests
./bin/mlops_test

# Start ROI dashboard
python3 src/mlops/customer_roi_dashboard.py

# Deploy to AWS
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name predis-pilot \
  --template-body file://deployment/cloud_marketplace/aws/cloudformation_template.yaml
```

### 10. Summary

Epic 4 is comprehensively planned and ready for execution. The shift from "demo polish" to "customer deployment" is reflected throughout the planning. With 60 story points across 6 stories, the epic focuses on:

1. **Production MLOps** - Automated learning from real data
2. **Customer Success** - 2-3 pilots with ROI tracking
3. **Enterprise Features** - Security, monitoring, compliance
4. **Series A Readiness** - Evidence-based fundraising

All foundational work is complete. When you return, you can immediately start implementing the MLOps pipeline while I handle any parallel tasks you assign.

**Epic 4 is ready for launch! 🚀**
