# Epic 4: Production Deployment & Customer Validation

**Timeline**: Weeks 17-24 (2 months)  
**Goal**: Transform Predis from working prototype to customer-deployed system with MLOps pipeline  
**Success Criteria**: 
- 2-3 customer pilot deployments collecting real access patterns
- MLOps pipeline with automated retraining and drift detection
- Real-world performance validation (not synthetic)
- Series A fundraising readiness with customer traction

---

## Epic 4 Strategic Focus

### Beyond Original Demo Polish - Now Customer Deployment
Given your massive performance achievements (15,000x vs. targeted 25x), Epic 4 should focus on **customer validation** rather than just demo polish. You're ready for real deployments.

### New Epic 4 Positioning
- **From**: "Make demo investor-ready"
- **To**: "Deploy with customers and validate business model"

---

## Story 4.1: MLOps Production Pipeline (Priority: P0, Points: 13)
**As a** production Predis system  
**I want** automated ML lifecycle management  
**So that** I can continuously improve performance as patterns evolve

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated data collection from production cache access patterns
- [ ] Drift detection using statistical tests (KS test, PSI)
- [ ] Automated model retraining when drift detected or on schedule
- [ ] A/B testing framework for safe model deployments
- [ ] Model versioning and rollback capabilities
- [ ] Performance monitoring with alerts for degradation

### Technical Implementation

    """
    def __init__(self, cache_instance):
        self.cache = cache_instance
        self.pattern_buffer = CircularBuffer(max_size=1M)
        self.feature_extractor = RealTimeFeatureExtractor()
        
    def log_access(self, key, operation, timestamp):
        # Log with minimal overhead (<0.1%)
        # Extract features in background thread
        # Batch export to training pipeline
        pass
```

        # Statistical significance testing
        # Return drift score and confidence
        pass
        
    def should_retrain(self, drift_score, performance_metrics):
        # Combine drift detection with performance degradation
        # Configurable thresholds for different trigger conditions
        # Business logic for retraining decisions
        pass
```

        # Compare performance to current production model
        # Return new model if better, else keep current
        pass
        
    def deploy_model_with_ab_test(self, new_model, traffic_split=0.1):
        # Deploy new model to 10% of traffic
        # Monitor performance metrics in real-time
        # Gradual rollout if performance improved

## Epic 4 Risk Mitigation

### Customer Deployment Risks
- **Risk**: Customer environments differ significantly from development
- **Mitigation**: Containerized deployment with comprehensive testing
- **Fallback**: Cloud-hosted pilot environments as backup

### MLOps Complexity Risks  
- **Risk**: MLOps pipeline too complex for initial deployments
- **Mitigation**: Phased rollout starting with basic monitoring
- **Fallback**: Manual model updates with automated monitoring

### Customer Acquisition Risks
- **Risk**: Difficulty finding pilot customers
- **Mitigation**: Leverage professional network and industry connections
- **Fallback**: Cloud marketplace deployment for broader reach

### Performance Translation Risks
- **Risk**: Synthetic performance doesn't translate to real workloads
- **Mitigation**: Conservative projections and extensive real-world testing
- **Fallback**: Focus on absolute performance rather than relative improvement claims
