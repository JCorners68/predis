# Predis Development Workflow & Standards

This document outlines the development workflow, coding standards, and collaboration practices for the Predis project.

## Git Workflow

### Branching Strategy

**Main Branches:**
- `main` - Production-ready code, always deployable
- `develop` - Integration branch for features, epic development

**Feature Branches:**
- `feature/epic-X-story-Y-description` - Individual story implementation
- `feature/gpu-memory-optimization` - Major feature work
- `hotfix/critical-bug-fix` - Critical production fixes

**Example Branch Names:**
```
feature/epic-1-story-1-gpu-memory-manager
feature/epic-1-story-2-cuda-hash-table
hotfix/memory-leak-cache-manager
```

### Development Process

1. **Start New Work:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/epic-X-story-Y-description
   ```

2. **Regular Development:**
   ```bash
   # Make changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add GPU memory allocation for cache entries
   
   - Implement CUDA memory management in MemoryManager
   - Add error handling for VRAM allocation failures
   - Update cache size tracking and statistics
   
   ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code"
   ```

3. **Push and Create PR:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/epic-X-story-Y-description
   # Create pull request via GitHub CLI or web interface
   ```

4. **Merge Process:**
   - **Squash merge** for feature branches to main
   - **Merge commit** for hotfixes to preserve history
   - Delete feature branch after merge

### Commit Message Standards

**Format:**
```
<type>: <short description>

<detailed description>
- <specific change 1>
- <specific change 2>
- <specific change 3>

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix  
- `perf:` - Performance improvement
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring
- `test:` - Adding/updating tests
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `build:` - Build system changes

- [ ] **Documentation** - Clear comments and updated docs?

**Review Timeline:**
- **Small changes** (<100 lines): 24 hours
- **Medium changes** (100-500 lines): 48 hours  
- **Large changes** (>500 lines): 72 hours

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Requirements

**Minimum Coverage:**
- **Unit Tests**: 80% line coverage
- **Integration Tests**: All major workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Baseline measurements for all operations

**Test Categories:**

1. **Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/`)
   - Individual class/function testing
   - Mock dependencies for isolation
   - Fast execution (<1 second total)

2. **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`)
   - End-to-end workflow testing
   - GPU memory allocation/deallocation
   - Client API to cache core integration

3. **Performance Tests** (`tests/performance/`)
   - Benchmarking against Redis baseline
   - Memory usage validation
   - Throughput and latency measurements

4. **GPU Tests** (`tests/gpu/`)
   - CUDA kernel functionality
   - GPU memory management
   - Error handling for GPU failures

### Test Execution

**Local Development:**
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test suites
make unit-tests
make integration-tests
make performance-tests

# Run with coverage
make test-coverage
```

**Docker Environment:**
```bash
# GPU-specific tests
./dev_scripts/start_dev.sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec predis-dev make gpu-tests
```

## Release Process

### Version Numbering

**Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):**
- **MAJOR**: Breaking API changes
- **MINOR**: New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, backward compatible

**Pre-release Tags:**
- `v0.1.0-alpha.1` - Alpha releases for internal testing
- `v0.1.0-beta.1` - Beta releases for external validation
- `v0.1.0-rc.1` - Release candidates

### Release Checklist

**Pre-Release:**
