    dynamically allocate cache space between hint-driven and ML-driven prefetching with reallocation frequency between 1 and 30 seconds;
    maintain isolation between partitions with interference below 5%; and
    automatically adjust partition sizes based on relative effectiveness with adjustment latency below 50 milliseconds.

20. The system of claim 1, wherein the hint-driven cache optimization system achieves:
    end-to-end hint processing latency below 2 microseconds for at least 99% of hints;
    cache hit rate improvements between 30% and 75% compared to non-hint systems; and
    adaptation to changing application behavior within 1-5 seconds of behavior change detection.

## Actionable Steps for Your Lawyer

### Step 1: Draft Independent Claims (Week 1)
For each patent, create 2-3 independent claims covering:
- **System claims** (apparatus/device perspective)
- **Method claims** (process/steps perspective)  
- **Computer-readable medium claims** (software perspective)

### Step 2: Create Dependent Claim Trees (Week 2)
For each independent claim, draft 15-20 dependent claims that:
- Add one new limitation per dependent claim
- Progress from broad to narrow scope
- Cover alternative implementations
- Include specific parameters and thresholds

### Step 3: Claim Language Refinement (Week 3)
Ensure each claim:
- Uses proper patent language ("configured to", "wherein", "comprising")
- Has proper antecedent basis (every element properly introduced)
- Includes transition phrases that define scope
- Avoids indefinite terms

### Step 4: Cross-Reference with Specification (Week 4)
Verify that:
- Every claim element is described in the specification
- Specification provides enabling disclosure for each claim
- Alternative embodiments are described for key limitations
- Benefits and advantages are explained

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Wrong Approach
```
"A system that uses GPU acceleration and machine learning for caching"
```
**Problems**: Too broad, no specific elements, indefinite terms

### ✅ Correct Approach  
```
"A cache system comprising: a GPU having GPU memory; a hash table stored in the GPU memory; a machine learning engine configured to predict access patterns; wherein the hash table supports concurrent access by at least 1000 GPU threads"
```
**Why Better**: Specific elements, clear structure, definite limitations

## Timeline and Budget Impact

### Claim Drafting Timeline
- **Week 1**: Independent claims for all 4 patents (12 claims total)
- **Week 2**: Dependent claims trees (60-80 claims total)  
- **Week 3**: Refinement and cross-referencing
- **Week 4**: Final review and filing preparation

### Budget Allocation
- **Claim drafting**: $15,000-20,000 (largest cost component)
- **Claim refinement**: $3,000-5,000
- **USPTO fees**: $2,000-3,000 per patent
- **Total for claim work**: $20,000-28,000

This structured approach transforms your technical documentation into legally enforceable patent claims that provide meaningful protection for your innovations.
