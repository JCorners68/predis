- **Inventor contribution details** for each aspect of the invention
- **Problem-solution narratives** explaining why the invention was non-obvious
- **Alternative implementations considered** during development

### 2. Enhanced Prior Art Differentiation

For each identified prior art:

1. **Create explicit differentiation tables**:
   - List each relevant prior art feature
   - Describe how Predis differs technically
   - Explain why the differences are non-obvious

2. **Develop non-obviousness arguments**:
   - Document technical barriers overcome
   - Explain why combining prior technologies would not yield your solution
   - Provide evidence of failed attempts by others

### 3. Develop Fallback Claim Positions

Create a hierarchy of claims with progressive fallback positions:

- **Broadest claims** covering the core concept
- **Intermediate claims** adding key differentiating features
- **Narrow claims** with highly specific implementation details

This approach provides multiple layers of protection if broader claims are rejected.

### 4. Commercial Success Documentation

- **Adapt to evolving technology** in the GPU and ML fields
- **Target competitor implementations** that emerge after filing
- **Refine claim scope** based on examiner feedback
- **Address new use cases** discovered after initial filing

### 2. International Filing Strategy

Develop international filing strategy covering:

- **Priority markets** for your technology (US, EU, China, Japan, Korea)
- **PCT application timeline** following provisional filings
- **Cost estimates** for international prosecution
- **Foreign filing license requirements** for GPU/ML technology

### 3. Trade Secret Complementary Strategy

- **Specific ML model parameters** and training data
- **Proprietary tuning techniques** for performance optimization
- **Implementation details** not readily reverse-engineered
- **Business methods** related to the technology

### 4. Open Source Strategy

Consider strategic open source disclosure for:

| NVIDIA Patent Feature | Predis Implementation | Key Difference | Non-Obviousness Argument |

| General hash table implementation | Modified cuckoo hashing optimized for GPU | Custom cuckoo hash implementation with GPU-specific optimizations for parallel access | Standard hash tables perform poorly under high concurrency; our approach solves thread contention issues using novel atomic operations and path compression |
| Basic prefetching based on access patterns | ML-driven prefetching with confidence threshold | Uses dual-model architecture with confidence scoring | Overcomes the "prefetch pollution" problem that plagued previous attempts at predictive caching through novel confidence thresholding |
| Standard memory management | ML-informed memory tier classification | Dynamic classification of data across memory tiers based on ML prediction | Addresses the challenge of optimal data placement across heterogeneous memory by using ML to predict future value of cached items |
