    current_key = key
    current_value = value
    
    for i = 0 to max_iterations:
        // Try first hash location with atomic operation
        old_key = atomicCAS(&hashtable[hash1].key, EMPTY_KEY, current_key)
        if old_key == EMPTY_KEY or old_key == current_key:
            // Successfully inserted or key already exists
            if old_key == EMPTY_KEY:
                atomicExch(&hashtable[hash1].value, current_value)
            return SUCCESS
        
        // Try second hash location with atomic operation
        old_key = atomicCAS(&hashtable[hash2].key, EMPTY_KEY, current_key)
        if old_key == EMPTY_KEY or old_key == current_key:
            // Successfully inserted or key already exists
            if old_key == EMPTY_KEY:
                atomicExch(&hashtable[hash2].value, current_value)
            return SUCCESS
        
        // Need to evict one of the entries
        use_first_hash = (i % 2 == 0) // Alternate between hash locations
        evict_idx = use_first_hash ? hash1 : hash2
        
        // Perform eviction with atomic operations
        victim_key = atomicExch(&hashtable[evict_idx].key, current_key)
        victim_value = atomicExch(&hashtable[evict_idx].value, current_value)
        
        // Update for next iteration
        current_key = victim_key
        current_value = victim_value
        hash1 = HashFunction1(current_key)
        hash2 = HashFunction2(current_key)
    
    // Exceeded max iterations, need to resize or handle collision
    return PATH_COMPRESSION_OR_RESIZE_NEEDED

Function LookupKey(key, hashtable):
    // Compute both hash locations
    hash1 = HashFunction1(key)
    hash2 = HashFunction2(key)
    
    // Check bloom filter first for rapid rejection
    if not BloomFilter.MayContain(key):
        return NOT_FOUND
    
    // Check first location
    found_key = atomicLoad(&hashtable[hash1].key)
    if found_key == key:
        return atomicLoad(&hashtable[hash1].value)
    
    // Check second location
    found_key = atomicLoad(&hashtable[hash2].key)
    if found_key == key:
        return atomicLoad(&hashtable[hash2].value)
    
    // Key not found in direct locations, check path compression table
    return LookupInPathCompressionTable(key)

Kernel BatchInsert(keys[], values[], hashtable, count):
    thread_id = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x
    grid_stride = blockDim.x * gridDim.x
    
    for i = thread_id to count step grid_stride:
        if i < count:
            result = InsertKey(keys[i], values[i], hashtable)
            if result == PATH_COMPRESSION_OR_RESIZE_NEEDED:
                atomicAdd(&resize_needed_counter, 1)
```

#### Path Compression Mechanism

The cuckoo hash table implements a novel path compression mechanism that achieves compression ratios between 1.4:1 and 2.8:1:

```
Function InsertWithPathCompression(key, value, main_table, compression_table):
    // Try regular insertion first
    result = InsertKey(key, value, main_table)
    if result == SUCCESS:
        return SUCCESS
    
    // Need path compression - find a path that can be compressed
    path = FindCuckooPath(key, main_table, max_path_length=6)
    if path.length > 0:
        // Compress path by storing the key and the final location
        compression_entry = CreateCompressionEntry(key, path.final_location)
        
        // Insert into compression table with special tag
        compression_idx = HashForCompression(key) % compression_table.size
        atomicCAS(&compression_table[compression_idx].entry, EMPTY, compression_entry)
        
        // Update Bloom filter to include this key
        BloomFilter.Add(key)
        return SUCCESS
    
    // No path found, need to resize
    return RESIZE_NEEDED
```

### Hash Function Implementations

The system uses a combination of high-performance hash functions specifically optimized for GPU computation:

#### Primary Hash Functions

```
// MurmurHash3 optimized for GPU (32-bit)  
Function HashFunction1(key):
    // Constants for MurmurHash3
    c1 = 0xcc9e2d51
    c2 = 0x1b873593
    r1 = 15
    r2 = 13
    m = 5
    n = 0xe6546b64
    
    hash = SEED // 32-bit seed value (0x01000193)
    
    // Process key in 4-byte chunks
    for each 4-byte chunk in key:
        k = chunk
        k = k * c1
        k = rotate_left(k, r1)
        k = k * c2
        
        hash = hash ^ k
        hash = rotate_left(hash, r2)
        hash = hash * m + n
    
    // Handle remaining bytes
    // [omitted for brevity]
    
    // Finalization mix
    hash = hash ^ (hash >> 16)
    hash = hash * 0x85ebca6b
    hash = hash ^ (hash >> 13)
    hash = hash * 0xc2b2ae35
    hash = hash ^ (hash >> 16)
    
    return hash % TABLE_SIZE

// FNV-1a hash optimized for GPU
Function HashFunction2(key):
    hash = FNV_OFFSET_BASIS // 32-bit FNV offset basis (2166136261)
    
    for each byte in key:
        hash = hash ^ byte
        hash = hash * FNV_PRIME // 32-bit prime (16777619)
    
    return hash % TABLE_SIZE
```

#### Secondary Hash Functions for Path Compression

```
Function HashForCompression(key):
    // Jenkins one-at-a-time hash
    hash = 0
    
    for each byte in key:
        hash = hash + byte
        hash = hash + (hash << 10)
        hash = hash ^ (hash >> 6)
    
    hash = hash + (hash << 3)
    hash = hash ^ (hash >> 11)
    hash = hash + (hash << 15)
    
    return hash % COMPRESSION_TABLE_SIZE
```

### Atomic Operation Sequences for Thread Safety

To ensure thread safety in the highly parallel GPU environment, the system employs carefully orchestrated atomic operations:

#### Key Insertion Atomic Sequence

```
// Thread-safe insertion sequence
Function ThreadSafeInsert(key, value, table, index):
    // Phase 1: Try to claim the slot with atomic compare-and-swap
    old_key = atomicCAS(&table[index].key, EMPTY_KEY, key)
    
    if old_key == EMPTY_KEY:
        // Successfully claimed an empty slot
        // Phase 2: Set the value
        atomicExch(&table[index].value, value)
        // Phase 3: Mark entry as valid (visibility to other threads)
        atomicExch(&table[index].state, VALID)
        return SUCCESS
    
    else if old_key == key:
        // Key already exists, update the value
        // Use atomic exchange to handle concurrent updates
        atomicExch(&table[index].value, value)
        return SUCCESS
    
    else:
        // Slot is occupied by a different key
        return SLOT_OCCUPIED
```

#### Lockless Resize Operation

```
// Lockless table resize operation
Function InitiateResize(old_table, new_table):
    // Phase 1: Set resize flag atomically
    old_flag = atomicCAS(&resize_in_progress, 0, 1)
    if old_flag == 1:
        return ALREADY_RESIZING // Another thread is handling resize
    
    // Phase 2: Allocate new table (double size)
    new_table = AllocateNewTable(old_table.size * 2)
    
    // Phase 3: Set migration pointer atomically
    atomicExch(&migration_target, new_table)
    
    // Phase 4: Launch migration kernel
    LaunchMigrationKernel(old_table, new_table)
    
    return SUCCESS

Kernel MigrateTable(old_table, new_table):
    thread_id = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x
    grid_stride = blockDim.x * gridDim.x
    
    for i = thread_id to old_table.size step grid_stride:
        key = atomicLoad(&old_table[i].key)
        if key != EMPTY_KEY:
            value = atomicLoad(&old_table[i].value)
            InsertKey(key, value, new_table)
    
    // Last thread to finish sets completion flag
    if atomicAdd(&migration_counter, 1) == gridDim.x * blockDim.x - 1:
        atomicExch(&resize_in_progress, 0)
        atomicExch(&current_table, new_table)
```
