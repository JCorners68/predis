2. **Prior Art Concerns**
   - Which areas of prior art pose the greatest challenge to patentability?
   - How should we structure claims to differentiate from identified prior art?
   - Are there specific search areas we've overlooked?

3. **Claim Strategy**
   - What claim structure would provide the broadest protection?

   - Should we file them simultaneously or staggered?
   - What is the timeline from provisional to non-provisional filing?

6. **Budget Planning**
   - Is our estimated budget (~$3,500) realistic for three provisional patents?
   - How should we allocate the budget across the three patents?
   - What additional costs should we anticipate for non-provisional filings?
