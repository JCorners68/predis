## Next Steps

1. **Schedule Patent Attorney Consultation**
   - Use `attorney_consultation.md` to prepare for meeting
   - Expect to allocate ~$500 for initial consultation
   - Target scheduling within next 2 weeks

2. **Complete Prior Art Research**
   - Follow framework in `prior_art_research.md`
   - Focus on NVIDIA, AMD patents related to GPU memory
   - Review academic papers on ML for cache optimization
   - Estimate 1-2 weeks of focused research

3. **Prepare Invention Disclosure Forms**
   - Compile names and details of all inventors
   - Document conception dates and reduction to practice
   - Gather supporting evidence of invention process
   - Prepare for attorney review

4. **Review Technical Documentation**
   - Have technical team review all prepared documents
   - Check for technical accuracy and completeness
   - Identify any missing technical details
   - Validate performance claims with additional benchmarks if needed

5. **Budget Planning**
   - Confirm $3,500 allocation for provisional filings
   - Plan for $24,000-45,000 for non-provisional filings (future cost)
   - Consider international filing costs if applicable

## Priority Recommendations

1. **Focus on Patent 1 First**: The GPU-Accelerated Cache with ML Prefetching represents the core innovation and should be prioritized for filing.

2. **Emphasize Performance Differentiators**: The 10-50x performance improvements over traditional systems are compelling evidence of non-obviousness.

3. **Highlight Novel Combinations**: The integration of GPU acceleration with ML prefetching creates synergies that are not obvious from prior art.

4. **Document Unexpected Results**: The super-linear performance scaling and power efficiency improvements demonstrate non-obvious outcomes.

5. **Prepare Strong Non-Obviousness Arguments**: Use the barriers overcome and conventional wisdom challenged as evidence of non-obviousness.

## Conclusion

The patent documentation for Predis is now complete and ready for attorney review. The next critical step is scheduling a consultation with a patent attorney to validate the strategy and begin the formal patent application process. All technical documentation necessary for filing strong provisional patent applications has been prepared, positioning the company well for protecting its innovative technology.
