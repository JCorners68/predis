**Deadline**: Today EOD

The CMakeLists.txt files reference ~20 non-existent .cpp files. Either:
- Option A: Implement the missing files (see list below)
- Option B: Remove references and update build accordingly

Missing files:
```
src/mlops/retraining/auto_retraining_pipeline.cpp
src/mlops/customer_adaptation/customer_model_manager.cpp
src/mlops/customer_adaptation/federated_learning_client.cpp
src/enterprise/integration/monitoring_integrations.cpp
src/enterprise/integration/prometheus_exporter.cpp
src/enterprise/integration/datadog_exporter.cpp
src/enterprise/integration/newrelic_exporter.cpp
src/enterprise/integration/cloudwatch_exporter.cpp
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:

## üîí SECURITY VULNERABILITIES - Fix Before Any Deployment

### Task 2: Security Hardening (Assigned to: Security Engineer + Senior Dev)
**Deadline**: EOD Tuesday

**Critical Issues**:
1. **Remove hardcoded password** in `deployment/scripts/deploy_customer.sh:320`
   - Current: `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=predis123`
   - Fix: Use environment variables or secrets management

2. **Add input validation** for customer deployment script
   - Sanitize `CUSTOMER_ID` parameter
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Prevent command injection

3. **Implement secure data export** in `production_data_collector.cpp`
   - Validate export paths (prevent directory traversal)
   - Add encryption for sensitive access patterns
   - Implement access controls

4. **Generate auth tokens** properly
   - Script references `/etc/predis/auth_tokens.json` but never creates it
   - Implement secure token generation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in codebase
- [ ] All user inputs validated and sanitized
- [ ] Security scan passes (run `security-scan.sh`)
- [ ] Auth token generation implemented and tested

1. `production_data_collector.cpp`
   - File I/O error handling
   - Disk space checks
   - Export failure recovery
   - Zlib compression errors

2. `model_drift_detector.cpp`
   - Division by zero protection
   - Bounds checking for thresholds
   - Null checks for callbacks
   - Statistical calculation validation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] No silent failures
- [ ] All errors logged appropriately
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms in place
- [ ] Error handling unit tests

## üöÄ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

### Task 7: CircularBuffer Optimization (Assigned to: Performance Engineer)

Issues to fix:
1. False sharing between `head_` and `tail_` atomics
2. Inefficient modulo operation
3. Memory ordering over-specification

**Optimizations**:
```cpp
// Add padding to prevent false sharing
alignas(64) std::atomic<size_t> head_{0};
alignas(64) std::atomic<size_t> tail_{0};

// Use bit masking for power-of-2 sizes
size_t GetNextIndex(size_t current) const {
    return (current + 1) & (capacity_ - 1);
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Performance tests show 20%+ improvement
