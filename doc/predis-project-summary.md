# Predis Project Summary - Complete Context

## Project Overview

**Predis** is a GPU-accelerated key-value cache with predictive prefetching capabilities, designed to achieve 10-50x performance improvements over Redis through machine learning-driven optimization and massive GPU parallelism.

## Core Concept

### Problem Statement
Traditional caching solutions like Redis are fundamentally limited by:
- Single-threaded architecture creating bottlenecks
- CPU-based processing limiting parallelism
- Lack of predictive intelligence for prefetching
- Particularly acute I/O bottlenecks in AI/ML training workloads where 40-70% of training time is spent waiting for data

### Solution Architecture
Predis leverages GPU acceleration to solve these limitations through:
- **GPU-First Storage**: Primary cache data stored in GPU VRAM for ultra-fast access
- **Massive Parallelism**: Thousands of GPU cores processing cache operations simultaneously
- **ML-Driven Prefetching**: Machine learning models (NGBoost, Quantile LSTM) predict future access patterns
- **Intelligent Eviction**: ML-informed cache eviction policies
- **Hybrid Consistency**: Configurable consistency levels (strong vs. relaxed)

## Technical Architecture

### Major Components
1. **GPU Cache Core**: Manages key-value store in GPU VRAM with optimized data structures
2. **Predictive Prefetching Engine (PPE)**: Uses ML models to predict and prefetch data
3. **Access Pattern Logger**: Monitors and analyzes cache access patterns for ML training
4. **Cache API/SDK**: Provides Redis-compatible interface with extensions
5. **Flink Integration**: Real-time stream processing for ML training workloads

### Key Technologies
- **Core Implementation**: Mojo + C++ with CUDA for GPU programming
- **ML Models**: NGBoost, Quantile LSTM for time series prediction
- **Stream Processing**: Apache Flink for real-time data pipeline processing
- **GPU Optimization**: Custom GPU kernels, memory coalescing, parallel hash tables
