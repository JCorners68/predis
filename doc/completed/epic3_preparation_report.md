## Executive Summary

Epic 3 aims to implement machine learning-based predictive prefetching to achieve 20%+ cache hit rate improvement while addressing the write performance optimization gap discovered in Epic 2. This report outlines the preparation steps, technical challenges, and implementation strategy.

## Current State Analysis

### Epic 2 Performance Results

Based on benchmark analysis, we've identified a significant performance gap between read and write operations:

| Operation | Performance Improvement | Gap Analysis |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------|
| GET (10B) | 93.3x | Baseline |
| PUT (10B) | 47.3x | 1.97x slower than GET |
| GET (100B) | 90.3x | Baseline |
| PUT (100B) | 73.3x | 1.23x slower than GET |
| GET (1024B) | 99.0x | Baseline |
| PUT (1024B) | 70.3x | 1.41x slower than GET |
